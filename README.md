# Sand Grain

## Description
The APP is a platform aimed to those who would like to find the ideal voluntary event and make their life more meaningful helping others.
Sand Grain was developed using back-end dev (Node.js) as part of the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) developer bootcamp (WebDev-FT-0920) using a local Data Base and React for the front-end.

## User Stories
- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault .
- **homepage** - As a user I want to be able to access the homepage so that I see what the app is about and login and signup.
- **sign up** - As a user I want to sign up on the webpage so that I can see all the events that I could attend.
- **login** - As a user I want to be able to log in on the webpage so that I can get back to my account.
- **logout** - As a user I want to be able to log out from the webpage so that I can make sure no one will access my account.
- **user profile** - As an user want to see my events, favorites, events added and be able to modify the account details.
- **events** - A user can create new events, edit and delete them. Once creating an event the user becomes the organizer and it is displayed on the event's page. 
- **stars** - As an user you can get stars from the events you participate and become a super voluntary.
- **voluntary level** - Every event you participate will let you earn points to become a super volutary.
- **join/rate** - The user can not only create an event but join the ones created by other users. After participating, the user can rate how the event was and leave a comment.

## Backlog    
- Mark as favorite the events you like the most and save them in your User profile.
- To have the location pointed on the google maps API.
